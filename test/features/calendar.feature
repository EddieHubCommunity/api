        And the response property "ongoing" has a subobject with a field "name" that is equal to "Livestream YZ" should contain:
            | name        | "Livestream YZ"                      |

    Scenario: create event with wrong permissions
        Given authorization with "reading" permission
        And make a POST request to "/calendar" with:
            | name        | "Livestream XY"                       |
            | description | "descriptive Description"             |
            | url         | "https://domain.com"                  |
            | platform    | "YouTube"                             |
            | author      | {"platform":"discord","uid":"hubber"} |
            | startDate   | "2022-01-01T00:00:00.000Z"            |
            | endDate     | "2023-01-01T00:00:00.000Z"            |
        Then the response status code should be 403
        And the response should contain:
            | message    | "Forbidden" |
            | statusCode | 403         |
