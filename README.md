## Installation

### Gitpod

Gitpod is a Service, which provides development environments in the cloud. In case no plan is purchased the reguar `Opensource License` allows to use the service for 50 hours per month for free. +

All that needs to be done, is logging in to their service with a valid GitHub account.

1. [OPTIONAL] Install the Browser Extension from Gitpod. https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gitpod-always-ready-to-co/dodmmooeoklaejobgleioelladacbeki[Chrome] https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/gitpod/[Firefox]
2. Just hit the Gitpod button in the `README` file. Everything will spin up automatically.
3. When you're finished with your contribution just close the workspace.

## Running the app locally

```bash
$ npm install
```

When using gitpod, you can set environment-variables under the following link `https://gitpod.io/variables`. You can even scope the variable to a specific project.

For connecting the API against the database you can use `docker-compose`
```bash
# database
$ docker-compose up
```

```bash
# development
$ npm run start

# watch mode
$ npm run start:dev

# production mode
$ npm run start:prod
```

### API-Token

- The API-Token is a static token, which gets set in the environment-variables as `APPROVED_TOKENS`. 
- This token is used to authenticate an 'admin-App' against the API. The API-Token is used to generate **Bearer-Tokens**. 
- For generating more than one token they can be passed to the environment-variables as a comma-seperated list.

## Swagger docs

1. start the app `npm start`
2. visit `http://localhost:3000/swagger`

Official docs at https://docs.nestjs.com/openapi/introduction

## Test

```bash
# unit tests
$ npm run test

# e2e tests
$ npm run test:e2e

# test coverage
$ npm run test:cov
```

## Logging

Logging can be turned on by settings an environment-variable `DEBUG=true`.
If this variables is not true or undefiend no Logs will be made.

When set to `true` the App will Log every incoming request.

## Authentication

Authentication is handled via an environment-variable called `APPROVED_TOKENS`.
The approved tokens which are validated by the API are put there.
In case there should be multiple tokens, for multiple clients, they need to be **comma-seperated**.

To use Authentication the token needs to be passed in the `token`-header of the client-request.
