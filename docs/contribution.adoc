== Contribution

For contributing to the API **docker** and the cloned **code-base** is required. 
One of the dependencies to run the API is a Stargate-Container which represents the database. This service needs to run next to the actual API. +

There are multiple ways to make the contribution

* From your local development-environment
* From the cloud with **Gitpod**

=== Local Environment
When running the API on your local machine, its required to run docker.

1. Clone the Repo
2. Install your dependencies with `npm install`
3. Run `docker-compose up` to boot the Stargate-Container
4. As soon docker-compose is completely booted you can start the API with `npm run start:dev`

=== Gitpod

Gitpod is a Service, which provides development-environments in the cloud. In case no plan is purchased the reguar `Opensource License` allows to use the service for 50 hours per month for free. +
All that needs to be done, is logging in to their service with a valid Github-Account.
