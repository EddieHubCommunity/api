== Authentication

There are two authentication-methods within the API. The following chapter shall give an overview on how to create and then use the generated tokens for making requests to the API. +

Please take a look at the Swagger-Documentation of the API to see which tokens needs to be provided for using which endpoint or how the Body-Payload for the different endpoints need to look like. The Swagger-Documentation can be reached with the following path `<base-url>/swagger`

=== Tokens

The API uses two kinds of tokens. 

* **API-Token:** 
** The API-Token is a static token, which gets set in the environment-variables as `APPROVED_TOKENS`. 
** This token is used to authenticate an 'admin-App' against the API. The API-Token is used to generate **Bearer-Tokens**. 
** For generating more than one token they can be passed to the environment-variables as a comma-seperated list.
* **Bearer-Token**
** The Bearer-Token contains the **keyspace**, **Client-ID** and **Scopes**
** Currenty there are two Scopes available `Data.Read` and `Data.Write`
** Client-ID is a unique UUID, which gets generated when generating a new token
** The token isn't valid forever, it will expire after some time
** The **Keyspace** is the ServerID of the Discord-Bot which consumes the API

IMPORTANT: currently Datastax Astra isn't able to generate a new Keyspace on the fly. Therefor the keyspace needs to be created manually before being able to use a new one.


=== Authentication-Flow

There are several steps required to get a Bearer-Token to make authorized calls to the API:

1. Send a `POST` request to `/auth/token`. For that request an API-Token is required.
2. The response will contain a singed `accesstoken` and several additional info
3. This accesstoken can be used as Bearer-Token for the other Endpoints.
